  "The y-axis is labeled as \"SNR (55 MHz)\" and is scaled from 1 to 10^5.\n\nThe graph shows that as the primary energy increases, the countrate decreases. This is because the countrate is inversely proportional to the primary energy according to the relationship:\n\n\\[ \\text{Countrate} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\text{Primary Energy}} \\]\n\nThe lines are drawn in such a way that they intersect at the origin (0,0), indicating that at the lowest primary energy (10^15 eV), the countrate is the highest, and as the primary energy increases, the countrate decreases. The lines also show that the countrate decreases more rapidly as the primary energy increases, which is consistent with the inverse relationship described above.\n\nThe graph also includes a legend indicating the different values of N, which helps in identifying the different lines and their corresponding countrate values.",

However, the proposed method consistently outperforms the exhaustive search method across all levels of total utilization. \n\nAt a total utilization of 0.3, the proposed method achieves a higher percentage of schedulable task sets compared to the exhaustive search method. As the total utilization increases, the percentage of schedulable task sets for both methods decreases, but the proposed method consistently maintains a higher percentage of schedulable task sets.\n\nOverall, the graph demonstrates that the proposed method is more effective in achieving a higher percentage of schedulable task sets compared to the exhaustive search method, especially at higher levels of total utilization.",

  "The figure illustrates two main processes for improving the performance of object detection models, specifically for the task of detecting cars in images. The two processes are labeled as (a) Fine-Grained Domain Transfer for Label Initialization and (b) Iterative Semi-Supervised Self-Training.\n\n### (a) Fine-Grained Domain Transfer for Label Initialization\nThis process involves transferring fine-grained domain knowledge from a source domain to an intermediate domain. The source domain contains images of cars, and the intermediate domain contains images of cars with different backgrounds. The goal is to transfer the fine-grained knowledge from the source domain to the intermediate domain, which can then be used to initialize the detector in the target domain. The intermediate domain is created by taking the source domain images and applying a domain adaptation technique, such as domain adaptation, to make them more similar to the target domain images. The intermediate domain images are then used to initialize the detector in the target domain, which helps to improve the detection performance of the detector in the target domain.\n\n### (b) Iterative Semi-Supervised Self-Training\nThis process involves iteratively improving the detector's performance by using both labeled and unlabeled data.",
  "### (b) Iterative Semi-Supervised Self-Training\nThis process involves iteratively improving the detector's performance by using both labeled and unlabeled data. The detector is trained on both the source domain and the intermediate domain images, and then tested on the target domain images. The detector's performance is evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score. Based on the detector's performance, pseudo labels are generated for the target domain images. These pseudo labels are then used to train the detector in the target domain, which helps to improve the detector's performance. The process is repeated iteratively, with better pseudo labels being generated each time, until the detector's performance is satisfactory.\n\n### Summary\nThe figure shows two main processes for improving the performance of object detection models: Fine-Grained Domain Transfer for Label Initialization and Iterative Semi-Supervised Self-Training.

This is likely due to the 2-D stack capturing more information about the spatial distribution of the emission lines, which is crucial for understanding the physical properties of the object being observed.\n\nOverall, the graph demonstrates the importance of using multiple data points to accurately analyze spectra, especially when dealing with complex emission lines like those shown in the graph.",

  "The graph illustrates the concept of differential privacy and its relation to anonymization and sub-sampling. It starts with an original data distribution represented by a histogram, which shows the distribution of data points across different ranges. The histogram is divided into bins, and the height of each bin represents the frequency of data points within that range.\n\nThe graph then shows three different distributions, each representing a different anonymization technique:\n\n1. **Differential Privacy (DP):** This technique involves adding noise to the data to protect the privacy of individuals. The noise is designed to be indistinguishable from random noise, ensuring that the mean of the distribution remains unchanged on expectation. The histogram for DP shows that the mean of the distribution remains at 20, even after the data has been anonymized.\n\n2. **Anonymization:** This technique involves replacing individual data points with a random value, typically a uniform distribution. The anonymized data distribution is shown as a dashed line, which is identical to the original distribution in terms of mean and variance. This means that the mean of the anonymized data is also 20, and the variance is the same as the original distribution.\n\n3.",

The distribution of the selected subset is shown as a dashed line, which is identical to the original distribution in terms of mean and variance. This means that the mean of the sub-sampled data is also 20, and the variance is the same as the original distribution.\n\nThe graph concludes by stating that differential privacy does not change the mean of the data on expectation, which is a key property of differential privacy. This means that the anonymization techniques used in the graph do not alter the overall distribution of the data, preserving the privacy of individuals while still allowing for useful analysis.",

  "The graph is titled \"Zero-shot Image Classification,\" and it compares the accuracy of two different training methods: fine-tuning and joint training. The x-axis represents the number of steps, ranging from 1 to 4, while the y-axis represents the accuracy of the model in percentage.\n\nThe graph shows two lines: one for fine-tuning and one for joint training. The fine-tuning line starts at a low accuracy of approximately 5% and increases steadily with each step, reaching a maximum accuracy of around 25% after 4 steps. The joint training line starts at a higher accuracy of around 10% and also increases with each step, reaching a maximum accuracy of around 25% after 4 steps.\n\nThe graph demonstrates that joint training consistently outperforms fine-tuning in terms of accuracy, with a higher maximum accuracy and a faster increase in accuracy over the number of steps.",
