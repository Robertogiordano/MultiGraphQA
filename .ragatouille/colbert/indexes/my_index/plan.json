The surface density is measured in units of \\(\\log \\Sigma [h^{-2} \\, \\text{Mpc}^{-2}]\\), where \\(h\\) is the Hubble constant. The graph has three different lines representing different scenarios:\n\n1. **Black Line (f_spec = 1)**: This line represents the surface density when the factor \\(f_{\\text{spec}}\\) is equal to 1. This line is a straight line with a negative slope, indicating that the surface density decreases as the radius increases.\n\n2. **Dashed Blue Line (f_spec \u2260 1, w\/o corr.)**: This line represents the surface density when \\(f_{\\text{spec}}\\) is not equal to 1, but without any correction. This line also shows a negative slope, indicating a decrease in surface density with increasing radius.\n\n3. **Dotted Blue Line (f_spec \u2260 1, with corr.)**: This line represents the surface density when \\(f_{\\text{spec}}\\) is not equal to 1, with a correction applied.",

This line has a slightly different slope compared to the dashed blue line, indicating that the correction has a small effect on the surface density.\n\nThe x-axis represents the radius in units of \\(h^{-1} \\, \\text{Mpc}\\), and the y-axis represents the surface density in units of \\(\\log \\Sigma [h^{-2} \\, \\text{Mpc}^{-2}]\\).\n\nThe graph shows that the surface density decreases as the radius increases, and the correction applied to the surface density has a small effect on the overall trend.",
